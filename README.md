# HedgeClog

_A fire broke out at "Hedgehogs and associates" !
All hedgehogs have to leave the building!
But co-workers need to keep a safe distance from each othersâ€™ spikes !
Help them get through the fire hazard!_


# Description

A puzzle game of 17 levels: It will take you about 30 minutes to finish the game.

We went for scarce gameplay mechanics and tried to explore one different idea by level without repeating ourselves.

If a level is too difficult, you can skip it using the top left buttons. Level 10 is simpler than average ;)

We made all assets ourselves except the music: "Wonderful" by Scott Buckley.
